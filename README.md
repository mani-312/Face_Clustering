# Image_Clustering
# Motivation :
I always wondered how Google Photos app clusters all the images into different segments, where each segment corresponds to images of a person. It literally saves the time if you want to view all the images of a person without going and checking every image.

## Optimimum number of clusters K value of K-Means Clusterring

- From the graph, we can infer elbow is present at K = 5
- So, Number of clusters K = 5
